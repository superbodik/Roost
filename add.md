# add.md — design notes and roadmap (for me to keep improving this project)

This file is not user documentation — it's my own working notes so that the
next time I touch this repo, I pick up the same design language instead of
reinventing it. Update this file whenever a new page/pattern is added or a
plan changes; treat it as append/edit, not write-once.

## Current state (as of this writing)

Pages wired into `App.tsx`'s sidebar: **Servers** (dashboard, `pages/Dashboard.tsx`
+ `components/ServerList.tsx`), **Nodes** (`pages/Nodes.tsx`), **Settings**
(`pages/Settings.tsx` — version + update check). Clicking "Manage" on a
server card now goes somewhere: **`pages/ServerView.tsx`**, tab-bar with
Overview/Console/Files/Databases/Schedules — only Overview is real (power
buttons + live CPU/RAM/Disk meters), the other four are honest "not
implemented yet" panels, not fake UI. **Activity** is still a static,
unwired nav item.

Backend REST surface: auth (login/me), nodes (list/create, admin-gated),
servers (list/get/power — power is now genuinely wired end to end, see
below), version (get/check-update), WS gateway (`/ws/servers/{uuid}`) that
now actually relays live stats (polls the daemon every 2s while at least
one browser is subscribed, stops when the last one leaves) — console
relay is not built yet, only stats.

**Power actions and live stats are real now, not stubbed.** The chain that
makes this work: `NodeHandler.Create` encrypts the raw daemon token
(AES-256-GCM, key = SHA-256 of `PANEL_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, see
`internal/crypto/aesgcm.go`) into `nodes.daemon_token_encrypted` alongside
the existing bcrypt hash (hash stays for future daemon-side auth
verification if that direction is ever added; encrypted copy is what lets
the *panel* re-authenticate outbound to wingsd). `cmd/panel/main.go`'s
`nodeClientResolver` decrypts it per-call and builds a real
`daemonclient.Client`. `daemon/internal/api/handlers.go` grew a
`GET /servers/{uuid}/stats` endpoint (CPU % computed from the standard
cpu-delta/system-delta/online-cpus formula, docker one-shot stats mode).
`ws.Hub` grew a lazy per-server poller (`FetchStats` callback + a
`pollers map[uuid.UUID]context.CancelFunc`) instead of a global ticker
over every server, so idle servers cost nothing.

**Migrations are now a real numbered system**, not a single re-run file.
`backend/migrations/000N_*.sql`, tracked in a `schema_migrations` table,
applied via `scripts/database.sh`'s `apply_migrations` — called both from
fresh installs (`provision_database`) and from `write_panel_env`/`run_update`
on existing installs (previously, `write_panel_env` returned immediately
if `panel.env` already existed, which meant **schema changes silently
never reached already-installed panels** — caught this while adding
migration `0002`, backfilled a bootstrap check so existing databases with
the old single-file schema and no `schema_migrations` row get `0001`
marked as already-applied instead of the migration runner trying to
`CREATE TABLE users` again and failing).

Installer (`install.sh` + `scripts/*.sh`): language select (EN/RU with
real explanations, not just translated strings), Docker/Postgres/Redis
provisioning, domain + Let's Encrypt, interactive admin bootstrap, node
install with a non-interactive fast path (`WINGSD_DAEMON_TOKEN=... bash
<(curl ...)`), update mechanism (`PANEL_UPDATE=1 ./install.sh`, now also
runs `apply_migrations`), full destructive uninstall gated behind typing
`DELETE`.

## Design conventions — follow these before inventing new patterns

1. **Never invent new CSS.** `frontend/src/styles/panel.css` is the design
   system; it was handed to me finished and I don't touch it. Every new page
   is built by finding the closest existing section in panel.css and reusing
   its classes verbatim, even if the semantic match is a little loose (e.g.
   the Nodes table reuses `.db-table/.db-head/.db-row` — "database list"
   markup — because it's the right shape of table, not because nodes are
   databases). If a new page truly needs a shape nothing in panel.css
   covers, that's the one exception where adding a small amount of new CSS
   in a *separate* file is acceptable — but check twice first.
2. **Copyable-command pattern**, established in Nodes/Settings: when an
   action needs to happen on a *different* machine than the browser (install
   a node, run an update), the UI's job is to show a single copy-pastable
   shell command (`.api-item` + `.api-key` + a `.btn-sm` "Copy" button using
   `navigator.clipboard`), not to try to execute it remotely. The panel
   process runs as `www-data` with no privilege to restart its own systemd
   unit or touch Docker on other hosts — don't build a "click to apply"
   button that secretly shells out; it can't have the permissions to do that
   safely, and giving it those permissions is a bigger security decision
   than a UI ticket.
3. **New sidebar page checklist** (do all four or the page is orphaned):
   add the `View` union type in `App.tsx`, add the `nav-item` with
   `onClick={() => goTo('x')}` and the `active` class ternary, add the
   render branch in `<main>`, and reset `activeServer` in `goTo()` if the
   page has no concept of a "current server" (copy the existing pattern,
   don't rewrite it).
4. **i18n pattern** (installer only, not the frontend yet): all
   user-facing *explanatory* strings go through `scripts/i18n.sh`'s
   `MSG_EN`/`MSG_RU` tables and `msg()`. Plumbing/log lines (`log_ok`,
   `log_step`) stay English-only — i18n is for the handful of steps where a
   Russian operator genuinely needs the "why", not for every log line.
5. **Non-interactive fast paths**: every interactive installer prompt should
   have an env-var bypass (`WINGSD_DAEMON_TOKEN`, `PANEL_UPDATE`) so the
   website can eventually generate a single copy-paste command for it. When
   adding a new interactive step, ask "would a copy-paste command from the
   website want to skip this?" — if yes, add the env var check at the same
   time, not as a follow-up.
6. **No comments in code.** This was an explicit, deliberate instruction
   from the project owner, applied retroactively across the whole codebase
   (Go, TS, SQL, proto, bash). Keep following it for new code: no `//`, `#`,
   `--`, or `/* */` explanatory comments anywhere in source files. This
   file and other `.md` docs are the exception — comments belong in design
   notes, not in code.
7. **Build/version discipline**: `scripts/panel.sh`'s `build_panel_binaries`
   embeds `commit`/`buildDate` via `-ldflags -X main.commit=... -X
   main.buildDate=...` into `cmd/panel`. If another binary ever needs to
   report its own version (wingsd, for instance), wire it the same way
   rather than inventing a second mechanism.
8. **Secrets that the panel needs to use later (not just verify) get
   encrypted, not hashed.** `daemon_token_hash` (bcrypt) proves someone
   presented the right token; it can never answer "what was the token" —
   that's what `daemon_token_encrypted` (AES-GCM via `internal/crypto`,
   keyed off `PANEL_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) is for. Before adding another secret
   column, ask which of these two questions the code actually needs
   answered later.
9. **Any new SQL schema change is a new numbered file in
   `backend/migrations/`, never an edit to `0001_init.sql`.** The migration
   runner tracks applied files in `schema_migrations`; editing an old file
   in place means already-deployed panels never see the change (they've
   already recorded that filename as applied). Bump the number instead.
10. **Live per-server data (stats now, console later) is relayed lazily.**
    `ws.Hub` only starts polling/streaming a server once a browser
    subscribes to `/ws/servers/{uuid}`, and stops the moment the last one
    disconnects (see `pollers map[uuid.UUID]context.CancelFunc` in
    `internal/ws/hub.go`). Don't build a global "poll every server every
    N seconds" loop — most servers have nobody watching at any given
    moment, and that's needless load on every node for no benefit.

## Roadmap — rough priority order

### Near-term (Server Detail's remaining tabs — Overview is done)
- **Console tab** — the obvious next one; unlike when this was first written,
  the hard part (real daemon auth) is already solved, so this is now mostly
  plumbing: dial the daemon's `/ws/servers/{uuid}` from the panel (using the
  same `nodeClientResolver` decrypted token, over WS instead of HTTP),
  relay daemon->browser lines into `ws.Hub.Broadcast` and browser->daemon
  keystrokes back, using the same lazy-subscribe/cancel-on-empty pattern
  the stats poller already established. `console.Hub.Serve` on the daemon
  side already does exactly the send/receive shape needed; nothing new
  required there.
- **Files tab** — needs daemon file-manager RPCs first (list/read/write/
  delete/rename over HTTP or the proto's streaming RPCs — see
  docs/PROTOCOL.md §2), then the `.files-table` UI. Bigger lift than
  Console; do Console first.
- **Databases tab** — `server_databases` table exists, no handler. Needs a
  decision on how DB credentials actually get provisioned (a MySQL/Postgres
  instance per node? shared? the schema has `database_host_id` pointing at
  a `database_hosts` table that was deliberately never created — "out of
  scope v1" per the migration's own note).
- **Schedules tab** — `server_schedules`/`schedule_tasks` tables exist, no
  handler, no cron runner. The runner is the real work here (some process
  needs to wake up and check `cron_minute`/`cron_hour`/etc against wall
  clock and fire `schedule_tasks` in `sequence_id` order) — the UI is the
  easy 10%.
- **Activity page** — the sidebar nav item already exists and does nothing.
  panel.css has `.act-table`/`.act-row` ready. Backend has an
  `activity_logs` table but nothing writes to it yet — writing activity
  log rows needs to happen at the point of action (login, power actions,
  node creation), not as an afterthought bolted onto the table later. Do
  this alongside Console/whatever's next, since power actions are exactly
  the kind of event this table is for and it's cheap to add a row at the
  same call site while already touching it.
- **Account page** — `.acc-grid`/`.acc-card`, `.api-list`/`.api-item` (API
  keys — backend `api_keys` table exists, no handler), `.twofa-card` (2FA —
  `users.totp_secret`/`totp_enabled` columns exist, unused).

### Mid-term (real functionality gaps, not just missing UI)
- There's still no create-server flow in the UI at all (no "Add Server"
  button anywhere, no egg/template picker) — `ServerHandler.Create` doesn't
  even exist yet, only List/Get/Power. This is now the single biggest gap
  between "looks like Pterodactyl" and "works like Pterodactyl", now that
  Power/stats are real. Needs: an egg picker (reads from the `eggs` table,
  which has zero seed data right now — nothing inserts eggs), an allocation
  picker (free rows in `allocations`), and a call into
  `daemonclient.Client.CreateServer` (already exists, unused by any handler).
- RBAC is currently binary (`is_admin` or nothing) — `auth.PermissionChecker`
  interface exists in `backend/internal/auth/rbac.go` but has zero
  implementations wired into the router. `server_subusers` table exists
  for per-server sharing but nothing reads it.
- gRPC migration for the daemon protocol (proto file is complete,
  `daemonclient`/`daemon/internal/api` are still the HTTP/WS stand-in) —
  low urgency, only matters once file-manager/backup streaming RPCs need
  the bidirectional-stream ergonomics gRPC gives you for free.

### Later / polish
- Frontend i18n (the installer got RU/EN; the SPA itself is still
  English-only — if the Russian-speaking installer experience matters,
  the dashboard probably should too, eventually).
- Refresh tokens (`auth.AccessTokenTTL` is 15 minutes, no refresh flow —
  users get silently kicked to the login screen on expiry via the 401
  handler in `api/client.ts`; fine for now, annoying at scale).
- SFTP server on wingsd (mentioned in the original spec, not started).

## Things I keep having to re-explain to myself — write them down once

- `scripts/database.sh`'s `wait_for_postgres` exists because of a real
  incident: VPS images built from container templates ship
  `/usr/sbin/policy-rc.d` that silently blocks `postgresql-16`'s postinst
  from creating a cluster. `neutralize_policy_rc_d` (in `lib.sh`) fixes the
  root cause; `wait_for_postgres`'s cluster-creation fallback is defense in
  depth for hosts that were already broken before that fix existed. Don't
  "simplify" either of these away — they're both load-bearing.
- The frontend never had a login screen until a user hit a live 401 in
  production and asked "why doesn't anything work" — the lesson: when
  scaffolding a new page that hits an authenticated endpoint, check there's
  actually a way to get a token into `localStorage` before calling it done.
- `install.sh`'s self-clone-and-exec only fires when `scripts/lib.sh` isn't
  next to it (i.e. running via `bash <(curl ...)` with nothing checked out
  locally) — don't add prompts before that check runs, they'd never be
  reached in the one-liner case since the script re-execs itself immediately.
- Any "if the env/config file already exists, skip everything" guard
  (`write_panel_env`'s original shape) is a trap for anything that needs to
  run on *every* install, not just the first one — found this the hard way
  with migrations: they were silently skipped on every update because they
  were bolted onto the same early-return as secret generation. When adding
  a new "only do this once" step, ask separately "does this specific piece
  need to happen once, or every time" — don't assume the whole function is
  one atomic once-only unit.
